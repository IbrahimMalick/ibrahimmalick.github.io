# GitHub Pages Deployment Requirements Analysis

## Overview
To deploy the interactive AI course to GitHub Pages at http://ibrahimmalick.github.io/, we need to understand the requirements and limitations of GitHub Pages and how to adapt our course content accordingly.

## GitHub Pages Requirements

1. **Repository Structure**:
   - GitHub Pages can be served from either the root directory or a `/docs` folder in the main branch
   - Alternatively, it can be served from a dedicated `gh-pages` branch

2. **Supported Content Types**:
   - Static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
   - Markdown files (with Jekyll processing)
   - GitHub Pages does not support server-side processing

3. **Custom Domain**:
   - The site will be available at http://ibrahimmalick.github.io/ by default
   - Custom domains can be configured if needed

4. **File Size Limitations**:
   - GitHub repositories have soft limits on size (typically 1GB)
   - GitHub Pages sites should be kept reasonably small for performance

## Adaptation Needed for Our Course

1. **MDX to HTML Conversion**:
   - Our course is currently in MDX format, which is not directly supported by GitHub Pages
   - We need to convert the MDX content to static HTML or use a framework that can process MDX

2. **Interactive Elements**:
   - The Charts component used in our Manus Page needs to be replaced with a JavaScript-based charting library
   - All interactive visualizations need to be implemented with client-side JavaScript

3. **Repository Organization**:
   - Create a well-structured repository with separate directories for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and assets
   - Ensure proper linking between files

4. **Navigation and User Experience**:
   - Implement navigation between different modules and lessons
   - Ensure responsive design for various devices

## Recommended Approach

1. **Use a Static Site Generator**:
   - Next.js with static export
   - Gatsby
   - Or simple HTML/CSS/JS if complexity is manageable

2. **Charting Libraries**:
   - Chart.js for simple charts
   - D3.js for more complex visualizations

3. **Deployment Strategy**:
   - Create a GitHub repository at github.com/ibrahimmalick/ibrahimmalick.github.io
   - Set up GitHub Actions for automated builds if using a framework
   - Configure GitHub Pages in repository settings

4. **Testing**:
   - Test locally before deployment
   - Verify all interactive elements work as expected
